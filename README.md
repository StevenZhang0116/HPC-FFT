***Benchmarking Fast Fourier Transform Parallelization Algorithms using OpenMP and CUDA***

This repository serves for the final report for MATH-GA 2012 High Performance Computing in Spring 2022 instructed by Professor Benjamin Peherstorfer, NYU CIMS. 

Detailed description of files: 

**fft_openmp.cpp**: OpenMP implementation of FFT

**fft_serial.cpp**: Serial version of FFT

**analyze_result.py**: Analyze the results (running time/MFLOPS) for OpenMP/serial trails

**fft_stockham.cu**: CUDA Version of FFT
